"""Proxy fallback middleware.

Intercepts requests for sub-resources of proxied dev servers.
When a page is loaded through /api/proxy/{port}/, its sub-resources
(JS modules, CSS, images) use absolute paths like /@vite/client or
/node_modules/... which resolve against the cptr origin.  This
middleware detects those requests via the Referer header and a
path-to-port cache, then proxies them to the correct local port.

The cache chain works like this:
  1. /api/proxy/5174/ loads HTML with <script src="/@vite/client">
  2. Browser requests /@vite/client with Referer containing /api/proxy/5174/
  3. Middleware extracts port 5174, proxies, caches /@vite/client -> 5174
  4. /@vite/client imports /node_modules/foo
  5. Referer is /@vite/client, middleware looks up cache -> port 5174
  6. Chain continues indefinitely
