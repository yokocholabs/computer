# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 📱 **Tool calls no longer overflow on mobile.** Fixed tool call rendering that could exceed the parent container width on narrow screens.
- 📱 **Settings tabs scroll horizontally on mobile.** The settings tab bar now scrolls on narrow screens instead of overflowing.

### Changed

- 🔤 **Tool call labels show filenames instead of full paths.** Tool call summaries like `Read`, `Edit`, and `Write` now display just the filename (e.g. `Read stores.ts`) instead of the full absolute path, keeping labels readable on all screen sizes.
- 📋 **Redesigned changelog modal.** The changelog is now presented as a clean, continuous vertical list with color-coded section badges.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 📱 **Improved mobile keyboard handling.** The terminal and chat now resize correctly when the on-screen keyboard opens on iOS and Android.
- 📱 **Fixed page bouncing on mobile.** Eliminated unwanted page scrolling and bounce effects on touch devices.

### Changed

- 🔄 **Model selection syncs across devices.** Your selected chat model now persists across browsers and devices instead of being saved locally.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- 🛑 **File browser no longer refreshes constantly.** Replaced the macOS `PollingObserver` (which generated a feedback loop of phantom filesystem events) with the native `FSEventsObserver`. Background refreshes are now silent — no more loading spinner flash on every update.
- 🔇 **Eliminated noisy filesystem watcher events.** The watcher now ignores changes in `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, and `node_modules` directories, which were triggering unnecessary file browser refreshes.
- ⚡ **Centralized git status store.** All components (GitBar, GitView, FileEditor, layout) now share a single `gitStatusStore` instead of each independently polling `git/status`. On page load, this reduces git status API calls from ~6+ down to 1.
- 🔁 **Reduced git polling frequency.** Removed the 5-second git status polling intervals that were running in multiple components simultaneously.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

- 🔧 **Tool system.** Extensible tool framework enabling AI agents to interact with the local filesystem, run commands, search the web (Brave, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Tavily), and read URLs. Streaming JSON parser for improved tool-calling reliability.
- 📎 **File mentions.** Type `@` in the chat input to mention files with an inline suggestion popup, giving the AI context about your codebase.
